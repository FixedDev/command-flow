## Platforms

`command-flow` core is platform-agnostic, however, it provides a way to integrate with
platform-specific features, such as native command registration, tab-completion/suggestions,
etc.

At the moment we support the following platforms:
- [Bukkit](bukkit.md)
- [Bukkit with Brigadier](brigadier.md)
- [BungeeCord](bungeecord.md)
- [Discord with JDA](discord-jda.md)
- [Velocity](velocity.md)

However, you can make your own platform implementation easily.
